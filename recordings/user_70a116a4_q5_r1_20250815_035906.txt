So, whenever there is a tight deadline, they always like split the task into different  sprints and different projects or even different projects and then based on the priority I  always make preferences which one I should work for, which one I should work next.  Based on the I will move by sprint code or come and go and then I have also informed  stakeholder project managers update the sprint code accordingly and then ensure completion. Thank you.
