I faced several technical challenges in my past projects. One being I significantly still  remember today it is moving data from SQL database into a VARO platform as you like storage.  The challenge was that it was a database raw DB file and then we let it do database  dumping so that means database admin should be there but we didn't have an admin  service really hard to get somebody to do it but I ended up doing it successfully.
