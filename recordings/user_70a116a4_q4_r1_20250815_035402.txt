So, describe a time when you entered a complex problem at work and walk was two steps you  took to the solvents.  Okay, so I had to deliver a specific report head count report to multiple stakeholders and  leadership teams across out Trishke and so it was more than 200 people as not everybody  could get a tablo license we had to just send because that was a critical report based on  which the entire business operation runs.  Thanks.
