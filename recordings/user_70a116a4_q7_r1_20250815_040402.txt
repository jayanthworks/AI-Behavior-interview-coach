I had to work on a very challenging project. I worked on multiple challenging projects.  One of them was converting or rather moving the data source from SQL database into a VARO platform  because it was difficult because the database had more than one dB of data which was huge  and then getting it from a SQL store into a VARO source was most challenging.  And I had to complete my manager and the vendor who I worked as able to do that. Thank you.
